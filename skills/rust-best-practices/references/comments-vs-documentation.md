Clear code beats comments that explain what the code already says. Use comments
for context that cannot be represented cleanly in names, types, tests, or public
documentation.

## Comments vs Rustdoc

| Need | Use `//` comment | Use `///` or `//!` docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explain local reasoning or trade-off | Yes | Usually no |
| Document public API behavior | No | Yes |
| Describe safety invariants | Yes, especially near `unsafe` | Yes for public unsafe APIs |
| Provide examples | Rarely | Yes, with doc tests |
| Link to ADR/design context | Yes | Sometimes |

## Good Comments Explain Why

```rust
// PERF: Keep the small lookup table inline; benchmarks showed the heap-backed
// version regressed parser throughput for short frames.
const FAST_PATH_LIMITS: [u16; 4] = [8, 16, 32, 64];
```

Use named prefixes for recurring comment types:

* `SAFETY:` for unsafe invariants.
* `PERF:` for measured performance trade-offs.
* `COMPAT:` for compatibility constraints.
* `CONTEXT:` for design or operational background.

```rust
// SAFETY: `ptr` came from `slice.as_ptr()` and `index < slice.len()` was checked
// immediately above, so the computed address is in-bounds for a shared read.
let value = unsafe { *ptr.add(index) };
```

## Bad Comments Restate Code

```rust
fn advance(offset: &mut usize) {
    // increment offset by one
    *offset += 1;
}
```

Prefer a better name, a smaller function, or a test that names the behavior.

## Replace Long Comments with Structure

Instead of narrating every step, extract functions with names that encode intent.

```rust
fn ingest_frame(frame: Frame) -> Result<(), IngestError> {
    validate_frame_header(&frame)?;
    let payload = decode_payload(frame)?;
    store_payload(payload)
}
```

Tests can then document each stage:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn validate_frame_header_rejects_missing_kind() {
        // ...
    }

    #[test]
    fn decode_payload_rejects_invalid_checksum() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## TODOs Should Become Issues

Do not leave vague TODOs in code. Link to a trackable issue and include the exit
condition.

```rust
// TODO(issue #412): Remove legacy checksum compatibility after v3 payloads are
// no longer accepted by the ingestion API.
```

## Public API Documentation

Use `///` for public items and include behavior, errors, panics, safety, and
examples where relevant.

```rust
/// Parses a wire marker into a normalized lowercase marker.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`MarkerError::Empty`] when `input` contains only whitespace.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// # use crate_name::{parse_marker, Marker};
/// let marker = parse_marker(" Ready ")?;
/// assert_eq!(marker.as_str(), "ready");
/// # Ok::<(), crate_name::MarkerError>(())
/// ```
pub fn parse_marker(input: &str) -> Result<Marker, MarkerError> {
    // ...
}
```

Use `//!` for module or crate-level documentation.

```rust
//! Queue coordination primitives.
//!
//! This module owns lease acquisition, renewal, and release for worker queues.
//! Callers should use [`Lease`] rather than storing raw lease tokens.
```

## Rustdoc Checklist

* Crate root has `//!` docs that explain what problem the crate solves.
* Public modules explain their invariants and main exports.
* Public structs/enums/traits explain their role and invariants.
* Public fallible functions have `# Errors`.
* Public panicking functions have `# Panics`.
* Public unsafe functions have `# Safety`.
* Examples compile under `cargo test --doc` unless intentionally marked.
* Intra-doc links are checked with `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links`.
