# Rust Best Practices

Use this skill when the user asks for Rust code, Rust refactors, code review,
performance review, error handling, documentation, API design, or lifecycle
modeling.

Assume **Rust 1.98 stable** and **edition 2024** unless the repository explicitly
declares a lower MSRV or the user gives a different target. Respect existing
`rust-toolchain.toml`, CI, `Cargo.toml`, workspace lints, target support, and
public API stability before introducing an API that exceeds the declared MSRV.

## Repository and Dependency Adoption Boundary

Bon (`bon`) and Statum (`statum`) are authorized by default in both new and
existing repositories. Use Bon for suitable builder work and Statum for real
lifecycle or protocol type-state work. Add the appropriate dependency when it is
needed for the requested implementation or refactor; do not ask the user to
approve these dependencies separately. Their absence from `Cargo.toml`, an
existing manual implementation, or a dependency-free crate is not an opt-out.

Inspect the applicable cargo-deny configuration for an explicit opt-out, including
crate- and version-specific bans on `bon` or `statum`. It is commonly `deny.toml`,
`.deny.toml`, or `.cargo/deny.toml`; follow the configuration selected by repository
tooling when it uses a different path. With no matching ban, proceed without a
dependency-approval prompt. A missing cargo-deny configuration is not a blocker
and does not require introducing cargo-deny. If a ban applies, identify its file
and rule and use a permitted alternative. Do not remove or weaken the rule to
force adoption. Honor an explicit user request to avoid a dependency or use a
manual pattern.

Default authorization does not waive MSRV, feature, `no_std`, target, public API,
license, source, or security constraints, including restrictions affecting
transitive dependencies. Select compatible versions and follow the repository's
manifest and lockfile conventions. Report a concrete incompatibility rather than
inventing an approval requirement. Keep adoption within the requested change;
do not migrate unrelated constructors, state machines, or APIs.

For other libraries, including Strum, template engines, and error-handling
libraries, preserve established dependencies, versions, patterns, and dependency
policy unless adoption or migration is part of the requested scope. Apply their
house-style preferences when already adopted or explicitly authorized; otherwise
use the established implementation and label alternatives as recommendations.
The Bon and Statum default authorization takes precedence over generic
adoption-or-authorization language in the references.

Reviews are read-only unless the user asks to apply changes. Separate correctness
findings from house-style suggestions; a manual implementation is not a defect
solely because a preferred library could generate it.

## Rust 1.98 Baseline Guidance

* Prefer stable Rust. Do not suggest nightly-only features unless the repository
  already uses nightly and the reason is explicit.
* Use `let PATTERN = expr else { ... };` for early exits where the fallback does
  not need the failed value.
* Use `?` for straightforward error propagation, `map_err` for typed translation,
  and `inspect_err` for local observability.
* Use `str::substr_range` and `[T]::subslice_range` to recover source offsets from
  subslices already derived from the same source. These APIs use provenance and
  pointer arithmetic; they do not search by value.
* Use `strip_circumfix` when a prefix and suffix must both be present and
  non-overlapping. Prefer it to chained stripping that can accidentally accept a
  one-sided match.
* Use `core::range::{Range, RangeInclusive, RangeFrom}` when a concrete stored
  range benefits from being `Copy`. For public APIs, usually accept
  `impl core::ops::RangeBounds<usize>` unless the concrete type is part of the
  domain model.
* Prefer direct typed operations: integer bit-inspection methods for bit-domain
  logic, `NonZero*::from_str_radix` for non-zero radix parsing, and
  `String::from_utf16le`/`from_utf16be` when byte order is part of the input
  format.
* Use `core::fmt::NumBuffer` with integer `format_into` only in measured,
  allocation-sensitive paths where the caller can reuse the buffer. Use normal
  formatting for ordinary code.
* Use floating-point `algebraic_*` operations only when profiling shows a benefit
  and the API contract tolerates reassociation, unspecified precision, and
  non-deterministic behavior for NaN, infinity, and signed zero.
* Prefer primitive `char` associated items such as `char::from_u32` and
  `char::REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER`.
* Prefer borrowing (`&str`, `&[T]`, `&T`) for read-only APIs. Take ownership only
  when the function stores, transforms, or consumes the value.
* Prefer `impl Trait` for single-use input polymorphism. Use named generics when
  multiple parameters or a return value must share the same type.
* Prefer static dispatch until heterogeneity, plugin boundaries, or ABI-like
  abstraction require `dyn Trait`.
* Keep runtime-symbol and FFI definitions lint-clean. Do not globally suppress
  `invalid_runtime_symbol_definitions`, `suspicious_runtime_symbol_definitions`,
  or `c_void_returns`; use a narrow, documented exception only at a real runtime
  or foreign-function boundary.
* Use `bon` for builders instead of hand-rolling type-state builders for ordinary
  construction. Bon is authorized by default under the cargo-deny boundary above.
* Use `statum` for real lifecycle or protocol type-state. Statum is authorized by
  default under the same boundary; do not use type-state as a generic replacement
  for builders or enums.
* Keep examples generic, self-contained, and domain-neutral unless the user gives
  domain vocabulary.
